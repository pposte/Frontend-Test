1. About Us Page

Using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML create an About Us page that allows a user to

click on one of the blue thumbnails of an employee below and have it blow up to

the position of “pane1”, while right sliding the existing pane 1 and pane 2 to the

position of pane 2 and 3. In addition to the JavaScript pane sliding functionality

spend some time to make the sliding action animation look smooth and the layout

beautiful. It’s very important that you focus on the UX and aesthetics of this page.

Transitions should be smooth and design should be attractive.
